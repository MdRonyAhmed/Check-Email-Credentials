# Check-Email-Credentials
This is a small project of Process automation. The goal of this project is to check email credentials. If you check the project you will find 5 different text files where email_credetial is for the list of emails
that will be checked. For the project requirement, I have used text files instead of CSV or other formats. And one more important thing is, the project will use the email as its password also
as it was also a requirement.

Other files have been used to store the output if the email's credential is correct then it will be saved on the successfull.txt file, if wrong then it will be saved on 
the wrong_pass.txt file, if the email is invalid it will be saved on the invalid_email.txt file. If it requires verification then it will be saved on the varification.txt file.
