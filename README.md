# Check-Email-Credentials
This is a process automation project focused on email credential checking. The objective is to verify the validity of email credentials. The project includes five different text files for storing various outputs and data.

The "email_credential.txt" file contains a list of email addresses to be checked. As per project requirements, text files were used instead of CSV or other formats. Additionally, an important aspect of this project is that the email address itself serves as the password.

The project output is stored in separate text files: "successful.txt" for successful email credentials, "wrong_pass.txt" for incorrect passwords, "invalid_email.txt" for invalid email addresses, and "verification.txt" for email addresses that require verification.

Please note that this is a small-scale project focused on email credential checking and utilizes text files for data storage.
